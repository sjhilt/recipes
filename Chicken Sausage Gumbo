## INSTRUCTIONS

### 1. Brown the chicken

2. Heat a small amount of oil in a heavy pot over medium high heat.
3. Brown chicken on all sides. Do not cook fully.
4. Remove chicken and set aside.

### 2. Brown the sausage
1. In the same pot, add sliced sausage.
2. Cook until lightly browned around the edges.
3. Remove sausage and set aside with the chicken.

### 3. Prepare the okra
1. In a separate large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of oil over medium high heat.
2. Add frozen okra directly to the skillet. Do not thaw beforehand.
3. Cook 20 to 30 minutes, stirring frequently, until the sliminess is mostly gone and the okra begins to lightly brown.
4. Remove from heat and set aside.

### 4. Make the roux
1. In the main gumbo pot, heat 1/2 cup oil over medium heat.
2. Sprinkle in the flour while stirring.
3. Stir constantly until the roux reaches a deep chocolate brown color. This may take 20 to 45 minutes depending on heat level.

### 5. Add the vegetables
1. Add onions, bell pepper, celery, and garlic to the roux.
2. Cook 5 to 7 minutes, stirring, until the vegetables soften.

### 6. Build the gumbo

2. Stir in the cooked okra.
3. Add the browned sausage.

5. Add the browned chicken (and any juices) back to the pot.

### 7. Simmer
1. Reduce heat to low or medium low.
2. Simmer at least 1 hour, stirring occasionally.
3. For deeper and richer flavor, continue a gentle simmer for several hours. Add small splashes of broth or water if liquid reduces too much.
4. Taste and adjust seasoning before serving.

### 8. Serve
1. Ladle gumbo into bowls over cooked white rice.
2. Garnish with green onions or parsley if desired.
